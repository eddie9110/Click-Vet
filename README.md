# Click-Vet
AUTHOR: Edwin Kahugu

I come from a background where my grandparents keep livestock on a small scale. My grandparents regularly require the services of a veterinary e.g. for artificial insemination, regular check-ups, vaccination against certain diseases e.t.c.

Since my grandparents are small scale livestock farmers, they cannot afford to hire a full time veterinarian, so they result to using the services of government employed veterinarians. This is where the problem lies. In Kenya, there is no organised way of accessing a veterinary. A livestock farmer usually calls a veterinary they personally know or from referral from a neighbour/friend.

This becomes a problem when you consider that veterinarians employed by the government usually move around counties hence they may not be available all the time if they are far.


As a result of the above problem, I came up with a solution in the form of this project called Click-Vet. This project solves this problem by having:

. A USSD app for a livestock farmer to request a list of veterinarians available within their area. This USSD app has a menu that allows a livestock farmer to choose their location which is a list of constituencies in their county, and then the contact details of a veterinarian within that constituency is sent to the farmer for them to call to see if that veterinarian is available.

. An app that can be used by county governments to monitor the diagnosis given by veterinarians in different areas within a county which will be saved in a database. This information can be useful in taking action when a trend of an infectious livestock disease is spotted in a particular part of the county, monitoring areas where there is low uptake of veterinary services so as to educate livestock farmers on the benefit of using veterinarians e.t.c.
