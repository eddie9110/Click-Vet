## Installation & usage
This project is licensed under the MIT software license
You can clone this into your local machine to customise it according to your needs, but first you need to:
- create an Africa's talking account to have access to a mobile phone simulator
- install ngrok on your local machine to expose your local host to the internet
- upload the ngrok url of your app to your africas talking account to allow the USSD app to communicate with your application

This project contains:
- A USSD app for a livestock farmer to request a list of veterinarians available within their area. This USSD app has a menu that allows a livestock farmer to choose their location which is a list of constituencies in their county, and then the contact details of a veterinarian within that constituency is sent to the farmer for them to call to see if that veterinarian is available.

- An app that can be used by county governments to monitor the diagnosis given by veterinarians in different areas within a county which will be saved in a database. This information can be useful in taking action when a trend of an infectious livestock disease is spotted in a particular part of the county, monitoring areas where there is low uptake of veterinary services so as to educate livestock farmers on the benefit of using veterinarians etc.
